                    **Your PyTorch Roadmap: MNIST Classification**

You can perform all these steps in a single Python file (train_mnist.py) or in cells within a Jupyter Notebook inside VS Code.


*Step 1: Load and Prepare Data*
1. Imports: Start with all your necessary imports (torch, torch.nn, torch.optim, torch.utils.data.DataLoader, torchvision.datasets, torchvision.transforms).

2. Define Transformations: Use torchvision.transforms.Compose to convert the raw images to Tensors and Normalize the data.

3. Download and Create Datasets: Use torchvision.datasets.MNIST to automatically download the training and test sets.

4. Create DataLoaders: Wrap the datasets in DataLoader objects. Remember to set:
    * batch_size (e.g., 64)
    * shuffle=True for the training data
    * shuffle=False for the test data


*Step 2: Define Your Neural Network Architecture*
1. Create a Class: Define a class (e.g., SimpleNN) that inherits from torch.nn.Module.

2. Initialize Layers (__init__): Inside the constructor, set up your network layers. For a basic Feedforward Network, you'll need:
    * An input size of 784 (because 28×28=784 pixels per image).
    * One or more [nn.Linear] (Fully Connected) layers for your hidden layers.
    * An output layer with size 10 (one for each digit, 0-9).

3. Define Data Flow (forward): Implement the forward(self, x) method:
    * The first operation must flatten the input images from a 28×28 matrix into a vector of 784 elements (x.view(-1, 28 * 28)).
    * Pass the output of each linear layer through a non-linear activation function (like F.relu) before sending it to the next layer.


*Step 3: Setup Training Components*
1. Instantiate Model: Create an instance of your SimpleNN class.

2. Loss Function (Criterion): Choose your loss function, which will be nn.CrossEntropyLoss() for this classification task.

3. Optimizer: Choose your optimization algorithm, typically torch.optim.Adam or torch.optim.SGD, and pass it your model's parameters (model.parameters()) and a learning rate (lr).


*Step 4: Implement the Training Loop*
Write the main loop that trains your model over a fixed number of epochs (passes through the full training set). Inside this loop, you'll iterate over the batches from your train_loader:

1. Zero Gradients: Call optimizer.zero_grad() before each batch to clear old gradient history.

2. Forward Pass: Calculate the model's predictions: outputs = model(images).

3. Calculate Loss: Calculate the error: loss = criterion(outputs, labels).

4. Backward Pass (Autograd): Call loss.backward() to compute all gradients.

5. Update Weights: Call optimizer.step() to adjust the model's parameters.

6. Monitor: Print the loss periodically to see the model is learning.


*Step 5: Evaluate Performance*
1. Set to Eval Mode: Call model.eval() (important for layers like Dropout, which you might add later).

2. Disable Gradients: Use with torch.no_grad(): around your evaluation code (since you don't need to compute gradients during testing).

3. Test Loop: Loop through the batches in your test loader.

4. Calculate Accuracy: Compare the model's final predictions to the true labels to compute the overall accuracy of your trained network.

5. Set to Train Mode: When done, call model.train() if you plan to do more training later.
